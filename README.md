# Content-Based Recommender System for Movies: An End-To-End Project

**Objective**: To build a recommender system that can recommend 5 similar movies when a user picks 1 movie from the database.

The dataset I've made use of is the [**`tmdb-movie-dataset`**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), taken from Kaggle.

I deployed the cloud-based application via Git. I had originally used the [**`Heroku`**](https://heroku.com) platform for hosting; however, since it doesn't have free services anymore, I migrated the app to [**`Render`**](https://render.com/).

The link to the recommender app developed with these codes can be accessed [**`here`**](https://cine-recs.com/).
