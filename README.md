# Content-Based Recommender System for Movies: An End-To-End Project

**Objective**: To build a recommender system that can recommend 5 similar movies when a user picks 1 movie from the database.

The dataset I've made use of is the [tmdb-movie-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), taken from Kaggle.

**Table of Contents**
1. Preprocessing
        
2. Text Vectorization

3. Creating the Main Function

4. Frontend and Streamlit

5. Deployment

I deployed the cloud-based application via Git. The Heroku website has the [steps for deploying with Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).

The link to the recommender app developed with these codes can be accessed [here](https://movie-recommendation-global.herokuapp.com/).
